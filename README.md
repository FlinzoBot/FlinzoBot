## How to start working with our bot?

> To start working with our bot, just click the `start` button in the chat with it or use the `/start` command!
> You will then see a list of commands available in our application and the most important information.

## Why should you choose us?

> -   No logs - we understand that users of such a private platform as Telegram care about their security and privacy. So no action performed by the bot is logged on our side.
>
> -   Open source code - so that each of our users can be sure of the security and stability of the code, we offer open source code. Unlike other web tools, thanks to the openness of our code you can be sure that everything is safe.

## What do we use in our project?

> The application code uses libraries that are in the `requirements.txt` file. When it comes to API, you can find all the libraries we used below:
